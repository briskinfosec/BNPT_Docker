## Introduction
<p align="justify"> Docker is a platform that is meant to create, deploy and run applications easily using containers. Containers allow a developer to consolidate an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries as well as other dependencies and ships it all out as one package. Briskinfosec, decided to make use of this platform and integrate with open source security assessment tools for use in network security assessments. We have named it "BNPT_Docker". It offers quality benefits like direct VA (Vulnerability Assessment) part, skipping few steps without affecting other processes, as other requirements exist inside the container. This docker is in Briskinfosec repository in docker cloud, which can be pulled from anywhere.. </p>

## Why BNPT_Docker?
<p align="justify"> This Docker comprises collection of open source tools which can be used for testing networks. This Docker has been created to simplify the tools installation and their dependencies by gathering the open source tools into a single Docker container thus making it platform independent. </p>

## Tools

### Nmap
<p aling="justify"> Nmap, short known for Network Mapper, is a free and open-source tool for vulnerability scanning and network discovery. Network administrators use Nmap to identify active devices on their networks, discovering hosts that are available and the services they offer, finding open ports and detecting security risks. </p>

### Masscan
<p aling="justify"> This is the fastest Internet port scanner. It can scan the entire Internet in under 6 minutes, transmitting 10 million packets per second. It produces results similar to nmap, the most famous port scanner. Internally, it operates more like scanrand, unicornscan, and ZenMap, using asynchronous transmission. The major difference is that it’s faster than these other scanners. </p>

### LNScan
<p aling="justify"> LNScan (Local Network Scanner), is an internal network scanner which is only used for enterprise security self-tests. Its features include: </p>
<ul type="square">
  <li> Fast and efficient, multi-process + multi-threaded combination. </li>
</ul>
