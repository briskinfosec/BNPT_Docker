## Why This Docker?
<p align="justify"> This Docker contains a collection of open source tools which can be used for Testing Networks. This Docker as been created to simplify the tools installation and their dependencies by gathering the open source tools into a single Docker container. With this Docker, tools which are platform dependent can be used independent to platform. </p>

## Tools

### Nmap
<p aling="justify"> Nmap, short for Network Mapper, is a free, open-source tool for vulnerability scanning and network discovery. Network administrators use Nmap to identify what devices are running on their systems, discovering hosts that are available and the services they offer, finding open ports and detecting security risks. </p>

### Masscan
<p aling="justify"> This is the fastest Internet port scanner. It can scan the entire Internet in under 6 minutes, transmitting 10 million packets per second.It produces results similar to nmap, the most famous port scanner. Internally, it operates more like scanrand, unicornscan, and ZMap, using asynchronous transmission. The major difference is that itâ€™s faster than these other scanners. </p>

### LNScan
<p aling="justify"> LNScan (Local Network Scanner), as an internal network scanner, is only used for enterprise security self-tests. </p>
<ul type="square">
  <li> Fast and efficient, multi-process + multi-threaded combination. </li>
  <li> Generate a html report after scanning to facilitate viewing. </li>
</ul>
